## The survey: who, what and when.

On August 2nd, 2019 we posted a survey on our website using the [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) web service. 
We received sixty-three responses over the next two weeks; 
during which time various people posted links to the survey intermittently on different social media platforms.  
![histogram of when people took the survey]({{ "/assets/survey_01/taken_at_histogram.png" | absolute_url }} "histogram of when people took the survey")  
On August 12th, we posted the survey to the open-comments section of a popular blog; 
most of the responses followed from that post, as can be seen above.
Respondents after August 12th seem to represent a different demographic, 
so below we'll distinguish between responses before and after that time.

People took the survey voluntarily, because they happened to see a link in one of the handful of places it was posted
and because they wanted to contribute. Because the participants were not selected randomly, it is not appropriate to
generalize from our results to the population at large. This survey confirms the _existance_ of certain trends, and
_suggests_ the prevalence of certain sentiments. 

## Do people care if the internet is lucrative?

The last questions we presented asked people how important it was that different parties get paid for their work. In
general people are concerned with the livelihood of journalists, writers, etc, but not with the livelihood of
publishers and aggregators.

## Do people use ad-blockers?

Ad-blocker usage varies by demographic. Most estimates put the prevalence of ad-blockers in the 10-40% range. _Most_ of
our respondents currently use ad-blockers. It's also interesting that few people report using ad-blockers only
occasionally or experimentally.  
![Screenshot: Do you use an ad-blocker, or have you ever used an ad-blocker for more than a few weeks?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_07.png" | absolute_url }} "question 07")

![Summary of questions 7 and 9.]({{ "/assets/survey_01/results_07_09.png" | absolute_url }} "results for questions 7 and 9")  
We also asked people who _don't_ use ad-blockers to estimate the value of their own attention to ads, but too few people gave responses to have
meaningful results.

## How would people like to pay for online content?

The first question we asked people was which common models they preferred.  
![Screenshot: Which of the following would you prefer?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_01.png" | absolute_url }} "question 01")  
The most popular option was Ã  la carte purchases, which is not a model supported by many platforms today.

## How well do people like the subscription model?

Monthly subscriptions seem less popular among consumers than among publishers. 
Several of our questions related to subscriptions people actually have.  
![Screenshot: With how many different websites do you have a paid subscription in order to access that site's content?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_02.png" | absolute_url }} "question 02")  
![Screenshot: About how much do you spend on such subscriptions each month?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_03.png" | absolute_url }} "question 03")  
![Screenshot: For which of the following kinds of media do you have a subscription?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_04.png" | absolute_url }} "question 04")  
In practice, most people have a few different subscriptions, mostly for music or television, for which they pay about \$20 a month.  
![Summary of question 02.]({{ "/assets/survey_01/results_02.png" | absolute_url }} "results for question 02")  
![Summary of question 03.]({{ "/assets/survey_01/results_03.png" | absolute_url }} "results for question 03")  
![Summary of question 04.]({{ "/assets/survey_01/results_04.png" | absolute_url }} "results for question 04")  
We asked what motivated people to sign up for subscriptions, and what they didn't like about subscriptions.  
![Screenshot: Think of recent times you've been prompted by a website to sign up for a paid subscription. Which of the following reasons to sign up felt strongest to you?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_05.png" | absolute_url }} "question 05")  
![Screenshot: Think of recent times you've been prompted by a website to sign up for a paid subscription. Which of the following reasons NOT to sign up felt strongest to you?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_06.png" | absolute_url }} "question 06")  
Ads don't seem to weigh heavily of peoples decisions to buy subscriptions. Costs do.
