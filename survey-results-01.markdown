## The survey: who, what and when.

On August 2nd, 2019 we posted a survey on our website using the [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) web service. 
We received sixty-three responses over the next two weeks; 
during which time various people posted links to the survey intermittently on different social media platforms.

On August 12th, we posted the survey to the open-comments section of a popular blog; 
most of the responses followed from that post, as can be seen above.
Respondents after August 12th seem to represent a different demographic, 
so where appropriate below we'll distinguish between responses before and after that time.

People took the survey voluntarily, because they happened to see a link in one of the handful of places it was posted
and because they wanted to contribute. Because the participants were not selected randomly, it is not appropriate to
generalize from our results to the population at large. This survey confirms the _existance_ of certain trends, and
_suggests_ the prevalence of certain sentiments. 

## Do people care if the internet is lucrative?

The last questions we asked people asked them how important it was that different parties get paid for their work. In
general people are concerned with the livelihood of journalists, writers, etc, but not with the livelihood of
publishers and aggregators.

## Do people use ad-blockers?

Ad-blocker usage varies by demographic. Most estimates put the prevalence of ad-blockers in the 10-40% range. _Most_ of
our respondents currently use ad-blockers. It's also interesting that few people report using ad-blockers only
occasionally or experimentally.  
![Screenshot: Do you use an ad-blocker, or have you ever used an ad-blocker for more than a few weeks?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_07.png" | absolute_url }} "question 07")

![Summary of questions 7 and 9.]({{ "/assets/survey_01/results_07_09.png" | absolute_url }} "results for questions 7 and 9")  
We also asked people who _don't_ use ad-blockers to estimate the value of their own attention to ads, but too few people gave responses to have
meaningful results.

## How would people like to pay for online content?

The first question we asked people was which common models they preferred.  
![Screenshot: Which of the following would you prefer?]({{ "/assets/survey_01/question_01.png" | absolute_url }} "question 01")  
The most popular option was Ã  la carte purchases.
